Welcome to Glycosylator's documentation!
========================================

Glycosylator is a Python package for the generation of glycan structures. It is designed to be a flexible and extensible, intended to be used in conjunction with other tools for the analysis of glycan structures.
Using Glycosylator you can not only generate 3D glycan models from IUPAC strings, but you can also generate completely new or modified glycans from scratch.
Finally, you can use Glycosylator to glycosylate scaffold molecules such as proteins or membranes (or anything else, really) to your liking. 

.. note::

   This documentation has content on `Glycosylator`. Glycosylator is built on top of `Biobuild` so a majority of the documentation is shared between the two.
   Check out the `Biobuild documentation <https://biobuild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ for more information on the underlying structure (and more general features) of Glycosylator.
