Glycosylator is built on top of Biobuild. Biobuild is a general-purpose fragment-based molecular assembly framework that can be used to build any kind of molecular structure. 
It is designed to be modular, extensible, and easy to use. As a consequence, Glycosylator can actually build more than just glycans!
Biobuild is written in Python and has integrations with many other popular libraries such as RDKit or Openbabel. 
Biobuild is available on GitHub at <link needed>.
