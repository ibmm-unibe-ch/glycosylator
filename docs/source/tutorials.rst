Tutorials
=========

On this page you will find some tutorials on how to use Glycosylator. Feel free to browse through them to learn more.

.. note:: 

    There are more tutorials available on how to use `Biobuild <https://biobuild.readthedocs.io>`_, which provides most of the features. 
    You can find them `here <https://biobuild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials.html>`_.

.. card:: Getting Started
   :link: https://biobuild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/getting_started.html


    This is the first basic tutorial from the Biobuild documentation. It covers the 101 of using Biobuild. Even though it is not Glycosylator specific, it is a good starting point.


.. card:: Building a glycan from a IUPAC string
   :link: example_building_glycan_iupac
   :link-type: ref


    In this tutorial we will build a glycan from a IUPAC string. This is the most convenient way to build a glycan in Glycosylator.


.. card:: Manually building glycans
   :link: example_building_glycan_manual
   :link-type: ref


    In this tutorial we will build a glycan from a IUPAC string. This is the most convenient way to build a glycan in Glycosylator.


.. card:: Glycosylating a protein 
    :link: example_protein_glycosylation
    :link-type: ref


    In this tutorial we will glycosylate a protein.


.. card:: Using Sequons
    :link: example_using_sequons
    :link-type: ref


    In this tutorial we will look at how to define custom sequons for protein glycosylation.


.. card:: Glycosylating a membrane 
    :link: example_membrane_glycosylation
    :link-type: ref


    In this tutorial we will glycosylate a lipid membrane.
