API Documentation
=================


.. note::

   This documentation only contains the functions and classes that `Glycosylator` implements directly. Most of the functionality is provided by `Biobuild` so a majority of the documentation can be found in  the `Biobuild documentation <https://biobuild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
